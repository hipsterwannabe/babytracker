## About ChartBabe


ChartBabe is a fully-responsive web application for new moms and dads to keep track of the sleeping and feeding habits and diaper changes of babies age 0-6 months. This information is used by doctors to ensure a baby's healthy development.

This app was built as a final project for the "Badlands" cohort of [Codeup](http://codeup.com), a 12-week web programming bootcamp located in San Antonio, TX.
